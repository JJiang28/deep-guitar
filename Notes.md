+ Started downloading the raw data for the project from this google sheet I write earlier. 
  + Link to sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r0Gr2UsoYX_xnLBGCV6i4gwGqoJp5KanUwcC6sysBOo/edit#gid=0
+ General notes about these files
  + Videos come in different resolutions and audio quality which may affect results.
+ I will handle all the preprocessing for the audio you just need to convert these into melspectrograms and handle video processing
+ Going to focus on the audio modality first before video.
